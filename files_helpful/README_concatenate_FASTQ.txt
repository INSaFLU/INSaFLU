###### To concatenate FASTQ files on MAC or WINDOWS, please:

Download one of these files:
  concat_fastq.bat (if your files are fastq)
  concat_fastqgz.bat (if your files are fastq.gz)

To concatenate several fastq/fastq.gz files into a single fastq/fastq.gz, do the following:
  - create a folder where you only put the fastq/fastq.gz you wish to concatenate
  - copy&paste the adequate “.bat” file (whether you have fastq or fastq.gz) to the same folder and double-click on the “.bat” file
  
This will automatically create a single file named “concat.fastq.gz” (or “concat.fastq”) inside the same folder. You can then rename this file as needed. (Note that this will not eliminate or change the original fastq inside the folder.)
