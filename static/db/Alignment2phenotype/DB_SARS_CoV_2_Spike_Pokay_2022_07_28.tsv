S477N	S	False	ACE2_host_variant_dependency	 This mutation's measured interaction affinity with ACE2:p.S19P (0.03% minor allele frequency,   found almost exclusively in African/African-Americans in the GnomAD database)  was significantly lower than the predicted value,   indicating that these mutations were not independent. This is consistent with the fact that the ACE2 residue S19   is adjacent to RBD residue S477 in the contact interface.   Barton et al.

(2021) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.438288v1  In silico methods (PyMOL and PDBePISA) involving mutagenesis (N501Y mutation) and interface analysis focusing on the Spike   RDB-ACE2 interaction showed that the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutant (lineage B.1.1.7) establishes a more significant number of   interactions relating to the mutant residue Y501 (Spike RDB) with residues Y41 and K353 (ACE2). This finding shows that the   increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is associated with the interaction force between the Spike RBD Y501   mutant residue with the ACE2 receptor, which in this strain is increased.

S494P	S	False	ACE2_receptor_binding_affinity	 Using molecular dynamic simulation, the mildly (~1kcal/mol) enhanced binding energy of this variant is primarily   contributed by Tyr505 (−4.98 kcal/mol) which is now involved in a strong hydrogen bonding network with Arg393.   Another important energetic contribution comes from the altered orientation of Tyr41 which is now involved with   two hydrogen-bonding interactions with Asp355 and Thr500.

K417N, E484K, N501Y	S	False	ACE2_receptor_binding_affinity	 Studying the key covariants in lineage of concern 501Y.V2,   observed about 2-fold increase in ACE2 binding vs wildtype, but greatly decreased mAb binding, suggesting evolutionary optimum tension between   immune evasion and ACE2 binding affinity as the N501Y variant alone has 10x increase in affinity but no effect on tested mAb binding.  Liu et al. (2021) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.16.431305v1  Reported slight increase in affinity compared to wild-type RBD on the cell surface (Kd = 45.2nM vs 56.9nM).  Tian et al. (2021) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.14.431117v2  The affinity of ACE2 for this mutation combination was twice as high as for wild type.  Having in mind that the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 is only 4-fold higher compared  to SARS-CoV-1, this factor of 2 is expected to be biologically significant.  Vogel et al. (2021) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.433887v1  RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 9-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than   wild type RBD. The E484K mutation does not significantly influence the affinity for the receptor,   while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result, RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds   3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 3-fold weaker than N501Y.  Laffeber et al. (2021) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432357v1  Using Mircoscale Thermopheresis, the B.1.351 variant harboring three mutations, binds ACE2 at nearly   five-fold greater affinity than the original SARS-COV-2 RBD (Kd 87.6, vs 402.5 nM).  Ramanathan et al.

Residues 20, 18, and 138 form a cluster underlying the 245–259 loop, which inserts into a groove between the light and heavy chains of Fab 159. In addition,  the N-terminal residues preceding residue 18 interact with the antibody and may be perturbed.   Given that there is likely a single supersite (""i"") for potent NTD-binding antibodies, the binding of many of these are likely affected.  Using 20 potent (primaruly anti-RBD) antibodies, neutralization was measured by a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and compared with   neutralization of Victoria (~wild type) and variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Compared to Victoria neutralization by the mAbs was significantly impacted by P.1,   with 12/20 showing > 10-fold reduction in FRNT50 titer and a number showing complete knockout of activity. The results with P.1 showed a   greater impact compared to B.1.1.7 but were, as expected, similar to those with B.1.351.  Dejnirattisai et al.

L452R	S	False	antibody_epitope_effects	 10 of 14 RBD-specific mAbs that showed at least 10-fold reduced neutralization of B.1.427/B.1.429 variant pseudotype (S13I, W152C, and L452R) were also found  to poorly bind to just a L452R RBD mutant, demonstrating a role for this mutation as an escape  mechanism for certain RBD-targeting mAbs.  McCallum et al. (2021) https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437925v1	Pokay DB	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437925v1

S13I	S	False	antibody_epitope_effects	 The S13I mutation dampened binding of 5 mAbs and abrogated binding of 5 additional mAbs out of 11 neutralizing mAbs evaluated.  Predicted to shift the signal peptide cleavage site from S13-Q14 to C15-V16, which can affect NTD conformation.   PG: in saying S12F does not shift the signal peptide nor affect mAb binding, this manuscript appears to contradict the   text of McCallum et al.'s earlier 2021 manuscript stating that S12F *does* affected some mAb binding  via putative signal peptide shift.

T470N, E471V, I472P	S	False	antibody_epitope_effects	 This mutation prevents neutralization by COVA2-29 (cluster I), COVA2-07 (cluster III) and COVA2-02 (cluster  VII).    It also reduces the activity of the most potent mAb COVA1-18 (cluster I) by 3-fold, whereas this   mAb is only minimally affected by other mutations. Moreover, TEI470-2NVP lowers the potency   of the structurally unmapped non-RBD cluster XI mAb,  COVA1-21, to the limit of detection.  Thus, this mutation negatively impacts the most mAbs, including representatives from four   separate epitope clusters.  Rees-Spear et al.
